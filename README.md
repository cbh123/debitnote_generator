# Debit Note Generator

Generates a docket number for a given debit note by interacting with a firebase DB. It is a personal project for a NYC law firm who uses this for their payment system. Users input docket numbers, which are then assigned a "debit note." The pair of docket-debit notes are then saved to the firebase DB, which is searchable by the user for reference.
